This is an implementation of Concurrent C built in 1986, 1987 at the Research
Institute of Computer Science (RIACS) at NASA Ames Research Center. Authors are
William Lynch, Joe Barerra, and Bob Brown.

This was built on Sun Microsystems Sun 3 workstations.  It probably doesn't
even compile any more.
