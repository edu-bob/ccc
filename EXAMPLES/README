Most of these guys work as advertised.

However....

numerical.cc is acting wierd.
i did not have time to find out quite what its problem is but
it is definitely something to be looked into.

in particular the print statement for the counter, when removed,
makes the program hang?????????

its probably something obvious and my brain is just too fried.
Or maybe its a serious bug with the compiler...
who knows
