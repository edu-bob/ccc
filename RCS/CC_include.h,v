 *  provided for all queues of a task; it might be better to have seperate
 *  locks for each queue as well, but there are some operations,
 *  mostly involving select statements with multiple accepts, which
 *  require varying degrees of mutual exclusion among several queues.
 *
 *  An important observation about the rendezvous mechanism is that
 *  a process can block waiting for no more than one server to accept him.
 *  This allows the task itself to be used as a queue element, instead of a
 *  structure with a task field. Thus the fields "next" and "prev" point
 *  to the tasks ahead and behind the given task, if it is on a transaction
 *  queue. When a task has been removed from a queue, "next" and "prev"
 *  are set equal to each other to mark the fact that they are not on a queue.

/*
 *  The next eight fields are used for transaction call synchronization
 *  and communication. Mutual exclusion to many of these fields is
 *  provided via "queuelock" (above). When a client makes a transaction call,
 *  it first places its parameters in its transaction block ("tblock"), which
 *  the server can access when it has accepted the client. The client
 *  then checks to see if the server is sleeping waiting for a transaction
 *  call. A server indicates that it is waiting for a transaction
 *  call on transaction "n" by setting "selectedtrans" to NOTRANS and
 *  "selectcase[n]" to some nonzero value. When the server is exeuting a select
 *  statement, this nonzero value is the case label for the accept alternative
 *  corresponding to that transaction, and several elements of "selectcase"
 *  may be so used. If the server is waiting, the client sets the server's
 *  "newclient" field to point to the client, and wakes the server up.
 *  If the server is not waiting, the client places himself on a queue;
 *  if the client is executing a timed transaction call, he will set
 *  "waiting" true, which tells the server to signal the client when he has been
 *  accepted. The server sets the clients "tsuccess" field true on successful
 *  completion of the transaction call, or false on abnormal completion,
 *  and supplies the return value for the transaction call (if there is one)
 *  through the client's transaction block. The "client" field in the
 *  server names the most recently accepted task; the "prevclient"
 *  field in a client task names the task accepted just before the server
 *  accepted the client task in question. (This is to allow a server to
 *  handle nested accept statements, which requires that the server remember
 *  several clients at once.)

/*
 *  These next fields are used to synchronize the various forms of
 *  process death, including selecting a terminate alternative, being aborted,
 *  and terminating after completion when all children have terminated.
 *  The lock "statelock" protects most of these fields. The field "unixpid"
 *  stores the unix pid of the actual process in which the task is running.
 *  "Firstchild", "nextsibling", and "prevsibling" are used to represent
 *  the family tree. (A task's parent and grandparent are accessible through
 *  the global variables "pp" and "gp", respectively.) "Completed" tells
 *  whether a task has completed; if "aborted" is true, then an abort
 *  was attempted on the task but it was checked out at the time
 *  (but when it is all checked in, it will be aborted.) When "choseterm"
 *  is true, a task must terminate; "prepared" means that a process is
 *  in a select statement with a terminate alternative and is ready
 *  to choose that alternative if the termination conditions become true.
 *  "Numloans" is used by the checkin/checkout routines. "Numprepared"
 *  holds the number of children who have "prepared" set true; and
 *  "numchildren" and "numgrandchildren" are self-explanatory.
